# bison -- GNU Bison, the parser generator (yacc-compatible). Needed by
# iproute2.recipe's own bison-driven grammar (already staged as a
# toolchain-only build dependency, /usr/share/bison in
# test/test_image_fixture.c's extras[]) and now, with this recipe,
# actually installable as a real runtime package into a target image
# for its own dev-toolchain use.
#
# Source is GNU's own canonical ftp.gnu.org release, checksum verified
# against two independent mirrors (ftp.gnu.org and mirrors.kernel.org)
# -- byte-identical, same sha256.

# A real, load-bearing runtime dependency, not just a build-time one:
# bison hardcodes the absolute path to the m4 binary it was configured
# against (confirmed via `strings` on the built binary --
# "/usr/bin/m4" is compiled in) and shells out to it at parser-
# generation time, not just while building bison itself -- so
# pkg_depends="m4" above is required, not optional, or a target image
# with bison but no m4 would fail at first real use, not at install
# time. Confirmed via ldd that bison itself links against nothing but
# libc; yacc is bison's own compatibility wrapper script, not a
# separate binary.
#
# usr/share/bison/ is ALSO a real runtime dependency, not docs -- it
# holds the m4sugar/skeleton files bison's own grammar generation
# reads at every real invocation, not just build-time output. The
# first version of this recipe wiped the whole of usr/share
# (man/info/locale, genuinely doc-only) and took usr/share/bison down
# with it by accident -- caught empirically the first time something
# actually tried to run bison from an image built with this recipe
# (a real kernel hostbuild, ADR-0056), not by inspection. Only the
# genuinely doc-only subdirectories are trimmed now.
