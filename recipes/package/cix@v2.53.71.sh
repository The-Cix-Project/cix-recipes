# v2.53.71 -- v2.53.69 did not link, and the fix is a check that would
# have said so.
#
# 69 failed with "unresolved reference to dhcp_apply_and_maybe_restart".
# api_network.c carried a LOCAL forward declaration of it, and it is
# static in main.c -- no shared header, so neither file had anything to
# disagree with. Both compiled clean under -Wall -Werror and only a
# real link found it.
#
# handle_network_delete() is back in main.c, where it belongs under
# ADR-0249 rule 2: deleting a network drops its DHCP configuration,
# which arms a rolling-restart timerfd.
#
# tools/verify-symbols.sh now compiles every source and asks the symbol
# tables the three questions the linker would: duplicate globals,
# symbols referenced externally but defined only as a static, and
# statics main.c declares without defining. It asks the symbol table
# rather than matching names, which is why it works, and injecting the
# fault proves it fails while both compilers stay silent.
#
# The sandbox builds cixctl and nothing else, so cixd is never linked
# there. That is the gap this closes, and it cost one build cycle to
# find.

	# #296: prove the new console-input scenario actually catches the
	# bug it was written for.
	#
	# The selftest above ran test_console_exec, which now includes an
	# INPUT scenario: it writes a keystroke as a binary websocket frame
	# and requires a real exec'd process to echo it back. A pass proves
	# nothing on its own -- the whole reason #294 shipped is that this
	# file was green while the console ignored every keystroke.
	#
	# v2.53.60 tried to prove it by DELETING the memset, and the test
	# still passed, so that build correctly failed. The reason is worth
	# keeping: not zeroing a malloc() only reproduces #294 when the
	# memory happens to be non-zero, and fresh kernel pages are zeroed,
	# so pty_out_len came up 0 and the code worked. That is also why
	# #294 was environment-dependent rather than constant.
	#
	# So the struct is POISONED instead of merely left unzeroed, which
	# is what uninitialised memory actually looked like on the host that
	# hit this: every field the code below assigns is still assigned,
	# and every field it forgot -- pty_out_len, the buffer -- is
	# garbage. That is exactly #294.
