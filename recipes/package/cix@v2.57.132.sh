#
# v2.57.132: a build says when it started and how long it has been
# going, the log viewer closes, and capacity reads as a proportion
# (#423, #433, #422)
#
# #423: GET /v1/pkg carries run_started_at, build_started_at and
# run_seconds. Both clocks already existed on the entry -- ADR-0272's
# run clock, and the stall detector's build clock -- and neither was
# ever reported, so a build showed that its output was 60 seconds old
# but not that it was in its fortieth minute. The two are separate
# because a run that never got past fetching has no build start at
# all, and those are among the runs most worth looking at. All three
# are null unless a run is open, gated on run_started_at != 0 rather
# than on a state, so a finished entry never reports the start time of
# a job that is over.
#
# run_seconds is deliberate rather than redundant: a counter ticking
# from an absolute daemon timestamp differences it against the
# browser's clock, so any skew appears as a wrong elapsed time from the
# first frame. The absolute value renders the start time, which a
# relative figure cannot; the server-computed span is the baseline the
# counter advances from, by local clock deltas only.
#
# #433: the log viewer was a bare <pre hidden> whose hidden was only
# ever cleared -- nothing in the file set it back and there was no
# close control, so once opened it stayed open for the life of the
# page. Now a panel with a Close button, the log's own name, and
# Escape, both routes through one closeBuildLog(). The movable-window
# and tail-following half stays open on the issue.
#
# #422: capacity shows a percentage beside the pair. The data was
# already in pkg-build-config, so no daemon change.

	# #296: prove the new console-input scenario actually catches the
	# bug it was written for.
	#
	# The selftest above ran test_console_exec, which now includes an
	# INPUT scenario: it writes a keystroke as a binary websocket frame
	# and requires a real exec'd process to echo it back. A pass proves
	# nothing on its own -- the whole reason #294 shipped is that this
	# file was green while the console ignored every keystroke.
	#
	# v2.53.60 tried to prove it by DELETING the memset, and the test
	# still passed, so that build correctly failed. The reason is worth
	# keeping: not zeroing a malloc() only reproduces #294 when the
	# memory happens to be non-zero, and fresh kernel pages are zeroed,
	# so pty_out_len came up 0 and the code worked. That is also why
	# #294 was environment-dependent rather than constant.
	#
	# So the struct is POISONED instead of merely left unzeroed, which
	# is what uninitialised memory actually looked like on the host that
	# hit this: every field the code below assigns is still assigned,
	# and every field it forgot -- pty_out_len, the buffer -- is
	# garbage. That is exactly #294.
