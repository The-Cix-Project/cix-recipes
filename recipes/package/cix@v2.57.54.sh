# v2.57.54: the rebuild drain starts an image once, not once per free
# slot (#382)
#
# Measured on the real host running v2.57.53: all ten chain slots held
# the same job, probe-run-trigger-dep@gateprobe1, ten times over. With
# max_concurrent_jobs at ten the build subsystem was saturated and no
# build of anything could start until cixd restarted. The daemon itself
# was fine -- GET /v1/health answered in 9 ms.
#
# A regression from ADR-0273 (v2.57.53, directly below). That change
# deliberately stopped popping an image from the rebuild queue when a
# build for it started, because an image may need several packages
# converged in turn and spending the approval grant on the first would
# strand the rest. Right for the grant; it removed the only thing
# preventing a second start. pkg_any_job_busy() asks whether ANY chain
# slot is free, not whether THIS image is already building, and a
# PKG_STATE_BUILDING entry never satisfies the manifest check -- so
# every drain pass started the same package again.
#
# image_has_job_in_flight() skips such an image exactly as a gated one
# is skipped: left in the queue, moved past. Skipping rather than
# stopping keeps ADR-0273's non-starvation property.
#
# pkg_image_forgotten() drops a deleted image's queue entry and any
# approval held against it -- a grant outlived its target, and
# GET /v1/pipeline/approvals named a deleted image as approved forever.

	# #296: prove the new console-input scenario actually catches the
	# bug it was written for.
	#
	# The selftest above ran test_console_exec, which now includes an
	# INPUT scenario: it writes a keystroke as a binary websocket frame
	# and requires a real exec'd process to echo it back. A pass proves
	# nothing on its own -- the whole reason #294 shipped is that this
	# file was green while the console ignored every keystroke.
	#
	# v2.53.60 tried to prove it by DELETING the memset, and the test
	# still passed, so that build correctly failed. The reason is worth
	# keeping: not zeroing a malloc() only reproduces #294 when the
	# memory happens to be non-zero, and fresh kernel pages are zeroed,
	# so pty_out_len came up 0 and the code worked. That is also why
	# #294 was environment-dependent rather than constant.
	#
	# So the struct is POISONED instead of merely left unzeroed, which
	# is what uninitialised memory actually looked like on the host that
	# hit this: every field the code below assigns is still assigned,
	# and every field it forgot -- pty_out_len, the buffer -- is
	# garbage. That is exactly #294.
