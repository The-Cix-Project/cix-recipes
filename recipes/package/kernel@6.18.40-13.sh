# Re-pinned to -13: -12 got further than any prior version -- bc and
# zlib's own fixes let it reach real kernel C compilation (objtool
# itself now links clean, no more __va_start error) -- but then hit a
# NEW blocker: real GCC 12.5.0 (this build_image's own current, ambient
# gcc -- NOT this project's own self-hosted 16.2.0, which `pkg ls`
# shows as merely "available" here, not yet installed/upgraded into
# dev) segfaults with an internal compiler error while constant-folding
# a completely ordinary `rol64()` shift/or expression in
# include/linux/bitops.h, reached from kernel/bounds.c. This re-pin
# exists purely to re-run the SAME build and check whether the ICE is
# deterministic (same crash again) or a one-off flake, before deciding
# whether this needs the gcc 16.2.0 upgrade -- not a further recipe
# content change of its own. (Also re-pinned rather than reusing -12
# directly because -12 already had its own first sync; the live-token
# dance for the self-fetch this time is being kept live across
# multiple retry attempts rather than reverted+deleted after the very
# first successful fetch, to avoid repeatedly hitting this same
# per-version sync-cache gap on every retry.)
#
# Re-pinned to -12: -11's own fetch/build/limits.h/objtool-link chain
# all worked correctly (fetched clean via a live-token substitution
# done BEFORE its first sync, dodging the per-version sync-cache gap
# -9/-10 hit -- see git history on this file for that full trail), and
# got all the way to a real, previously-undiscovered NEW blocker:
# `make[2]: *** [Kbuild:24: include/generated/timeconst.h] Error 127`
# (`bc: command not found` -- a genuinely missing dev-image package,
# fixed by installing the already-existing bc.recipe into dev, never
# needed before this session), immediately followed by tools/objtool's
# own final link failing on `/usr/lib/libz.so.1: undefined reference
# to '__va_start'` -- root-caused and fixed via zlib.recipe 1.3.2-3
# (TCC's own shared-library link never auto-adds its runtime helper
# archive libtcc1.a the way its executable link does, leaving zlib's
# own gzprintf()-driven va_start/va_arg calls genuinely unresolved
# inside libz.so.1 for any non-tcc-linked consumer; fixed at the
# source by statically resolving both symbols into libz.so.1 itself
# via LDFLAGS=/usr/lib/tcc/libtcc1.a at zlib's own configure time --
# see that recipe's own full trail). Both fixes are now installed into
# dev (bc 1.08.1, zlib 1.3.2-3, confirmed via nm -D that libz.so.1 no
# longer has any undefined va_ symbol) -- this re-pin is purely to
# retry the kernel build against a build_image state that now actually
# has every prerequisite objtool needs, not a further recipe-content
# change of its own.
#
# -8's own fix (wholesale-replace gcc's
# include-fixed/limits.h with a bare passthrough) got the kernel's own
# HOSTCC past its PATH_MAX gap, but was later proven incomplete while
# root-causing a DIFFERENT, unrelated package's build failure
# (elfutils 0.192-4 through -6's own history has the full trail): that
# wholesale replacement silently discards gcc's own correct ISO limit
# macros (UCHAR_MAX, INT_MAX, etc., all derived from real compiler
# builtins like __SCHAR_MAX__/__INT_MAX__) along with the one thing
# that was actually broken -- kernel.recipe -8 never noticed because
# none of the HOSTCC-compiled kconfig/objtool tooling it happened to
# exercise needed those particular macros from <limits.h>, but that
# was luck, not correctness, and left a known-inferior fix in place
# once the real defect was understood (contra this project's own "no
# hacks" standard).
#
# The real, fully root-caused defect (probe-gcc-headers v3 through
# v6): gcc's own include-fixed/limits.h content is CORRECT and matches
# a real working reference gcc byte-for-byte -- it is NOT broken. The
# actual bug is include-fixed/syslimits.h: confirmed via direct
# md5sum, it is a byte-for-byte IDENTICAL COPY of limits.h, instead of
# the short, distinct `#include_next`-chaining wrapper a complete
# fixincludes/mkheaders run is supposed to generate there. limits.h's
# own `#include "syslimits.h"` (right after defining _GCC_LIMITS_H_)
# therefore re-enters what is really just itself, with _GCC_LIMITS_H_
# already set -- it takes the `#else` branch, finds `_GCC_NEXT_LIMITS_H`
# was never defined (only the real wrapper sets it), and does nothing:
# glibc's real /usr/include/limits.h (MB_LEN_MAX=16, PATH_MAX via
# bits/posix1_lim.h, etc.) is never reached through <limits.h> at all.
#
# Real, minimal, correct fix (elfutils 0.192-5 established this):
# replace ONLY syslimits.h with the standard wrapper -- limits.h
# itself is left completely untouched, so its own correct ISO limit
# macros keep working AND glibc's real header becomes reachable again.
# Applied here as this recipe's own scoped, build-container-local
# workaround (this build's own upperdir), same posture as -8.
#
# tools/objtool's own earlier `cannot find -lelf` failure this same
# session (ADR-0056) is addressed by elfutils 0.192-6 (libelf only),
# but NOT via pkg_depends here -- pkg_hostbuild_start() (daemon/src/
# pkg.c) explicitly rejects any hostbuild recipe with a non-empty
# pkg_depends (dependency *resolution* targets "merge into an image",
# meaningless for a one-shot artifact harvest); every prerequisite
# must already be baked into --build-image's own rootfs via an
# ordinary `pkg install` first, confirmed the hard way when this
# recipe's own first version of this comment still had
# pkg_depends="elfutils" set and hostbuild rejected it outright with
# "no such recipe, or it failed to parse" (PKG_ERR_INVALID_RECIPE).
#
# gcc.recipe's own permanent fix (issue #55, updated with this fuller
# syslimits.h root cause) still needs its mkheaders/fixincludes step
# re-run properly, needing a full --enable-bootstrap rebuild to
# verify -- not done here.
