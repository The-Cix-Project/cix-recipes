# Re-pinned to -4: first real hostbuild attempt against a genuinely
# gcc-equipped "dev" image (gcc 12.5.0-10, issue #32 closed) surfaced a
# real HOSTCC header-ordering bug, not a kernel/config issue. `make
# allnoconfig`'s own scripts/kconfig/conf.o HOSTCC compile failed with
# "'PATH_MAX' undeclared", even though this image's libc-dev@2.36
# stages a complete, correct /usr/include/limits.h. Root cause: GCC's
# own fixincludes machinery (which pre-processes and stages a private
# copy of select system headers under
# usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/12.5.0/include-fixed/, searched
# *before* the real /usr/include in GCC's standard include order, each
# entry normally just `#include_next`-ing straight through to the real
# system header behind it) ran as part of gcc.recipe's own bootstrap,
# at a point in that same cumulative pkgbuild sandbox's history before
# `sed` existed there (sed.recipe was only added afterward, this same
# investigation) -- fixincludes shells out to sed/awk internally to
# rewrite known-broken vendor headers, and silently produced an
# incomplete include-fixed/limits.h when it couldn't, which then
# shadows the real header instead of transparently passing through to
# it. Confirmed via the failure signature itself (a macro missing, not
# a file-not-found -- meaning some limits.h *was* found and read, just
# not glibc's real one) and by libc-dev@2.36's own file listing
# already containing a complete, correct usr/include/limits.h
# unrelated to this gap.
#
# Fixed at the kernel-build level, not by touching gcc's own installed
# files or re-bootstrapping it: HOSTCFLAGS="-I/usr/include" puts the
# real glibc header directory ahead of GCC's built-in search path
# (a plain -I flag is always searched before GCC's own standard
# system/include-fixed directories, regardless of command-line
# position) for every host-tool compile this build performs
# (scripts/kconfig/conf.c and confdata.c being the ones that actually
# hit this, but applied uniformly rather than only to the specific
# target that happened to fail first).
