# libc-dev -- glibc's own development files: headers (stdio.h,
# stdlib.h, string.h, etc.) and the real C-runtime startup/teardown
# object files (crt1.o/crti.o/crtn.o and friends) every dynamically-
# linked ELF binary on this platform needs at link time. Found as a
# real, missing gap only by actually trying to compile a real C program
# with the newly-built gcc.recipe inside a real running container --
# every prior recipe in this project only ever produced a *finished*,
# already-linked binary (built inside the isolated sandbox, using the
# sandbox's own real glibc-dev), so nothing before this recipe ever
# needed glibc's own dev files present in a *target* image. gcc.recipe
# supplies its own crtbegin.o/crtend.o and libgcc -- those are GCC's
# own files, real and already staged there; crt1.o/crti.o/crtn.o and
# the libc headers below are glibc's, a genuinely separate package on
# every real distro (libc6-dev on Debian) and equally separate here.
#
# Building glibc itself from source is a real, giant undertaking of
# its own -- a multi-day bootstrap with its own kernel-header/build-
# system intricacies, squarely out of scope for this recipe set, the
# same "too complex to reasonably build here, stage the real
# pre-built host copy instead" call this project already made for the
# Go/Rust toolchains (test/test_image_fixture.c's own extras[],
# staged for the BUILD sandbox's own use). This recipe makes the
# equivalent real files available in a *target* image instead, which
# that toolchain-extras mechanism doesn't reach. pkg_source below is
# the real, genuine glibc 2.36 upstream release -- the exact version
# this build host's own already-installed libc6-dev is (confirmed via
# `dpkg -s libc6-dev`) -- fetched and checksum-verified against two
# independent GNU mirrors for real provenance, even though
# pkg_install() below copies the pre-built files directly from this
# build container's own toolchain-provided glibc-dev (not built from
# this tarball -- see pkg_build()'s own comment).

# point), crti.o/crtn.o (.init/.fini section prologue/epilogue,
# bracketing gcc's own crtbegin.o/crtend.o), Scrt1.o (the PIE variant,
# what gcc actually links by default -- confirmed via gcc.recipe's own
# `gcc -v` output using non-PIE crt1.o only because this recipe was
# tested with default flags; Scrt1.o staged too since PIE is this
# platform's own real default for anything not passing -no-pie), and
# gcrt1.o (profiling variant, real and small, kept for completeness)
# are all genuinely required at link time -- confirmed the hard way,
# `collect2: fatal error: cannot find 'ld'` then (after symlinking ld
# into gcc's own private prefix directory, a separate real finding --
# see gcc.recipe) `cannot find crt1.o: No such file or directory` on a
# real compile+link attempt inside a real running container. libc.so
# (a small real GNU ld script, not a symlink -- confirmed via `file`,
# `GROUP ( /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 ... )`-style, what `-lc`
# actually resolves against at link time) and libc.a (static libc,
# real and legitimate for anything statically linking) are kept too.
# The full real /usr/include tree (88MB, glibc's own headers plus
# every other dev package already installed on this build host --
# openssl, zlib, ncurses, sqlite3, etc.) is staged wholesale rather
# than hand-picking "just glibc's" headers out of it -- the same
# "too fragile to hand-curate perfectly, stage the real complete tree"
# reasoning already applied to gcc's own runtime library staging.
# Destination for the object files/libc.so/libc.a is /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
# (this project's own real runtime-library path, confirmed via `ls -la`
# that /lib is a genuine directory here, not a /usr/lib symlink the way
# a real usrmerge'd host has it) -- NOT /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, which
# is where the build host itself keeps them but which gcc's own
# LIBRARY_PATH (confirmed via `gcc -v`) never actually searches on this
# platform; only /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ is in that list.
#
# ADR-0057: the crt objects (crt1.o/crti.o/crtn.o/Scrt1.o/gcrt1.o/
# Mcrt1.o) are ALSO staged a second time at /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu --
# confirmed the hard way via a real cix.recipe hostbuild failing
# `tcc: error: file 'crt1.o' not found` even though the file genuinely
# existed at /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, then root-caused against tinycc's own
# upstream source (tcc.h's CONFIG_TCC_CRTPREFIX macro, confirmed vanilla,
# not a Debian patch): TCC maintains a separate, single-path "crt:"
# search list independent of its broader "libraries:" list used for
# libc.a/libc.so/-l lookups, and that single path defaults to
# /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu specifically -- a real, structural
# difference from gcc's own LIBRARY_PATH convention, not an oversight in
# either tool. libc.a/libc_nonshared.a/libpthread*.a are NOT duplicated
# there since TCC's broader "libraries:" list (confirmed via `tcc -vv`)
# already includes /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -- only the crt objects need
# the second copy. libc.so is itself a real GNU ld script, not a symlink (confirmed via `cat`):
# `GROUP ( /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
# libc_nonshared.a AS_NEEDED (...) )` -- its first path already matches
# this project's own convention, but its second (libc_nonshared.a, a
# small real static archive with the handful of libc symbols that are
# never in the shared lib) points at /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, which
# doesn't exist on this project's own images. Rather than introduce a
# second, otherwise-unused directory convention just for one file, the
# script is rewritten here to reference /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu for both
# paths, matching where libc_nonshared.a is actually staged below.
