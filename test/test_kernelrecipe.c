/*
 * ADR-0254's last link: turning a verified upstream checksum into a

 * The fixture is the REAL kernel recipe from the repo, not a synthetic
 * one. A generator that works on a tidy invented recipe and not on the
 * actual file is worthless, and the real file is where the hazards are:
 * two space-separated sources, two space-separated checksums, a
 * {{REPO_TOKEN}} placeholder, a git ref pinning the config, and 559
 * lines of comment prose that mention pkg_source and pkg_sha256 in
 * passing.
