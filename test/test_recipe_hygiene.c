/*
 * Recipe hygiene: the artifact-tier comment must name the artifact the
 * recipe actually fetches.
 *
 * Every recipe with a pkg_artifact_sha256 carries an explanatory block:
 *
 *   # With it set, an install fetches <artifact base_url>/zlib-1.3.2-9.tar.gz
 *
 * The filename is hardcoded, and it is copied forward verbatim when a
 * revision is bumped. Nobody updates it, so it drifts: 113 recipe
 * revisions name a file that is not theirs, bison@3.8.2-7 still saying
 * bison-3.8.2-2.tar.gz five revisions later (#226).
 *
 * Nothing breaks -- the checksum, which is the load-bearing part, was
 * always right. What breaks is the reader, who is told the wrong thing
 * by a comment that exists only to explain.
 *
 * Those 113 CANNOT be fixed. A published recipe version is immutable,
 * and pkg_recipe_add() permits exactly one edit to one: adding an
 * absent pkg_artifact_sha256 (recipe_adds_only_artifact_sha256()).
 * Correcting a comment in the same change was refused with HTTP 409,
 * which is the rule working. So this is a guard, not a cleanup.
 *
 * It scans only each package's LATEST revision, which is what makes the
 * number able to fall: a package fixes its comment when it next bumps,
 * and the count comes down with it. The going-forward convention is to
 * stop hardcoding the name at all --
 *
 *   # With it set, an install fetches <artifact base_url>/<name>-<version>.tar.gz
 *
 * -- which is accepted here as correct, cannot go stale, and costs the
 * reader nothing they could not already derive.

 * No pkg_* assignment may contain command substitution (#408).

 * error its predecessor hit -- `sed: command not found` -- in
 * backticks, so the build ran `sed:` as a program and died with
 * "/build/recipe.sh: line 44: sed:: command not found", which is the
 * very message it was quoting, for an entirely different reason. The
 * obvious reading is that the sed fix did not take.
 *
 * POST /v1/pkg/recipes accepted it (204) and ADR-0107 makes a
 * published revision immutable, so 1.5.7-2 is permanently a recipe
 * that cannot build. It has happened at least three times: tcc's own
 * rc-22 changelog records that rc-21 "never ran -- its own changelog
 * used backticks".
 *
 * Not a host-side execution risk, and worth stating so nobody
 * re-derives it: parse_recipe() reads pkg_* fields with
 * extract_line_value(), a line scan, never `sh -c`. The damage is
 * confined to the build container -- which is where the build is.
 *
 * Matched only at column 0, which is what the daemon's own line scan
 * parses and what the shell executes at top level. An indented
 * pkg_foo=$(...) inside pkg_build() is ordinary shell in a function
 * body and is correctly ignored. An escaped \` or \$( is not
 * substitution and is allowed -- tcc's changelogs use \$? deliberately.

 * them SUPERSEDED (zstd 1.5.7-2 < 1.5.7-3, tcc rc-21/rc-22 < rc-29,

 * 6.18.0-5/-9 < 6.18.0-17, probe-test-pki 2 < 7), so scanning latest
