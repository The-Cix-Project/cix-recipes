/*
 * ADR-0224, the Toolchain Tenet: TCC by right, gcc by evidence.
 *
 * The rule is that Cix's own code is always TCC -- no bar, no
 * exception -- and third-party packages are TCC by default and gcc
 * when TCC is difficult. ADR-0226 amended ADR-0224 here: the original
 * four-part bar and its required tracking issue NO LONGER APPLY to
 * third-party packages, because the owner's instruction is that moving
 * a package this project neither owns nor wrote should be the natural
 * change rather than a battle. What is still required is
 * pkg_toolchain= and pkg_toolchain_reason=, for auditability rather
 * than permission -- a reason may be as ordinary as "the language has
 * no TCC front end".
 *
 * The rule is not the interesting part -- an informal version of it
 * already existed, as prose in CLAUDE.md, and did not stop gcc
 * reaching 21 recipes without anyone counting.
 *
 * This is the part that makes it real: a NUMBER that changes visibly.
 * Adding a gcc package means editing the list below, in a diff,
 * deliberately. Since ADR-0226 this is a VISIBILITY device rather than
 * a debt ceiling -- the set is expected to GROW, and that is fine; what
 * must not happen is it growing without anyone seeing it -- the same device test_apigen uses to keep the REST
 * surface honest. A rule nobody can count is a rule that has already
 * been broken, and this project has the evidence: 34 of 139 installed
 * packages had drifted behind their recipes because nothing counted
 * them either (#217).
 *
 * Deliberately checks only what is mechanically true: whether a
 * recipe's pkg_build() invokes gcc. Whether the reason recorded beside
 * it is a GOOD reason is review, and a gate pretending to judge that
 * would be the kind that passes while the thing it names is wrong.
 *
 * Comments are excluded from the scan on purpose. Several recipes
 * discuss gcc at length -- why they do not use it, or what it did
 * differently -- and counting prose would make the number meaningless
 * within a week.
