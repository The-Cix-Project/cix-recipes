#
# v2.53.65 -- ADR-0249: main.c starts coming apart.
#
# main.c was 31,284 lines and 852 functions next to 68 sibling modules
# averaging around 600 lines. What held it together was mechanical
# rather than architectural: every handler ends by answering the
# client, and respond_json() and respond_error() were static in that
# file. respond_error() alone has 722 call sites, so no handler could
# move to another translation unit while its most common call was
# file-local.
#
# apiresp.c holds those three helpers now, above http.c rather than
# inside it, because http.c is deliberately JSON-agnostic and giving
# the transport a json_writer dependency to save one file would be a
# worse trade than the one being fixed. No call site changed.
#
# With that unblocked, sysctl, kmod and ntp move into api_sysctl.c,
# api_kmod.c and api_ntp.c. The existing layering is preserved: no
# subsystem module responds to HTTP, they return enums and know nothing
# about status codes or file descriptors.
#
# This build is what verifies it. The dev sandbox compiles every file
# individually but builds cixctl and nothing else, so a duplicate or
# missing definition across the new translation units can only be
# caught by a real link, and the handlers themselves only by the full
# selftest. Pure code motion, no logic changed, every call site
# untouched -- which is exactly the change that looks safe and needs
# proving anyway.

	# #296: prove the new console-input scenario actually catches the
	# bug it was written for.
	#
	# The selftest above ran test_console_exec, which now includes an
	# INPUT scenario: it writes a keystroke as a binary websocket frame
	# and requires a real exec'd process to echo it back. A pass proves
	# nothing on its own -- the whole reason #294 shipped is that this
	# file was green while the console ignored every keystroke.
	#
	# v2.53.60 tried to prove it by DELETING the memset, and the test
	# still passed, so that build correctly failed. The reason is worth
	# keeping: not zeroing a malloc() only reproduces #294 when the
	# memory happens to be non-zero, and fresh kernel pages are zeroed,
	# so pty_out_len came up 0 and the code worked. That is also why
	# #294 was environment-dependent rather than constant.
	#
	# So the struct is POISONED instead of merely left unzeroed, which
	# is what uninitialised memory actually looked like on the host that
	# hit this: every field the code below assigns is still assigned,
	# and every field it forgot -- pty_out_len, the buffer -- is
	# garbage. That is exactly #294.
